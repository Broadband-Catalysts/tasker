\alias{get_previous_start_times}
\title{Get previous process start times for multiple runs (batch query)}
\usage{
get_previous_start_times(con, run_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{Database connection}

\item{run_ids}{Vector of run_ids (UUIDs) to query}
}
\value{
Named list where names are run_ids and values are POSIXct start times (or NULL)
}
\description{
Efficiently retrieves the most recent process_start_time for multiple run_ids
in a single database query. Used for PID reuse detection.
}
\details{
Uses database-specific optimizations:
\itemize{
\item PostgreSQL: DISTINCT ON (most efficient)
\item MySQL/MariaDB: Window functions (ROW_NUMBER)
\item SQLite: Subquery with MAX/GROUP BY
\item Generic: Correlated subquery (works everywhere)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
start_times <- get_previous_start_times(con, c(run_id1, run_id2, run_id3))
prev_time <- start_times[[run_id1]]
}
}
