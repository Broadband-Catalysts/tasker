\title{Get or set the active task run context}
\usage{
tasker_context(run_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{run_id}{Character UUID of a task run, or NULL to query the current context}
}
\value{
The active run_id (invisibly when setting, visibly when getting)
}
\description{
This function manages the active run_id context for the current R session.
When a run_id is provided, it sets that as the active context. When called
without arguments, it returns the currently active run_id.
}
\details{
The context allows you to omit the run_id parameter from tasker functions,
making code cleaner and less repetitive. This is especially useful in
sequential workflows where a single task is being tracked.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Start a task - it becomes the active context
task_start("STAGE", "Task Name")

# Check what's active
tasker_context()  # Returns the run_id

# Explicitly set context (useful for switching between tasks)
tasker_context(some_run_id)

# Clear context
tasker_context(NULL)
}
}
